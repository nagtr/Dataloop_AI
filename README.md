# Dataloop Assignment

Home assignment or the Dataloop

## Part A - terraform repository structure

If we need to work with multiple environments in Terraform, there are a few ways we can take into consideration.
  1. Using the Terraform workspace - create separate environments within a single Terraform configuration.
  2. Using the environment directories - here we are going to maintain separate directories for each environment/cloud provider and its respective Terraform configurations.
  3. Using the external wrapper or tools like Terragrunt......

As per the assignment, I am using the second approach to create the structure in the repository.
